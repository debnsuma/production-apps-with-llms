This is the most important thing. You can have a good director in a bad location. It will work. You can have a good location, average director, it\\'s gonna be painful.\"\\n\\nHe explains that when expanding to a new country/city, they first identify one of their best existing employees who can take on the role of director/leader for that new location. The location is then chosen based on where that identified leader is from or prefers to be based. \\n\\nFor example, he chose to base their India operations in Gandhinagar because that\\'s where the director he selected (who was previously working for them in another country) was from originally. The director\\'s comfort, familiarity and ability to execute in that location was prioritized over evaluating potential locations strategically.\\n\\nSo in summary, for Fabian, having the right leadership talent trumps analyzing and selecting an optimal location when expanding his business to new regions in India.

       "[Document(page_content=\"that. You like how you're working, right? The reason is that um uh public companies tend to refocus on the short term, you know, you have to uh publish earning codes with the, the sales number and if the numbers are good, everyone is happy, they buy the shares. If numbers are bad, people are not happy and your employees are frustrated because they have shares and it's bad. So public companies have a tendency to focus on the short term to saves, saves of the moments of the quarter and so on. I don't want that the success of FU is always to build for the long term. And I don't want to see on to look for the short term or the sales number of the quarter. One, the other thing is I'm so much focused on productivity and efficiency. Uh When you get public, you need extra layers of reporting transparency, uh anything like that. Uh So second reason I don't want that I want to be super efficient, decide right away instead of asking the board of directors. Um And third, I like open and transparent communication. You know, I just said the company was 4.5 billion of euro. If I was a public company, I could go to jail because I disclosed information uh not be before the earning calls. I think if, if I would have sent that to maybe not publicly but to some I could go to jail. I don't want that. I want to be able to say whatever I want to inform my employees uh and be transparent. Why do you think founders choose to go public? I think a lot of them don't understand, it's just a way to get cash. Um But to understand the consequence of that, most of them don't catch it really another thing. It's bad. I think as a source of cash public is quite good, it's efficient but it comes with some drawbacks like you have to uh have extra layers of reporting complexity. You cannot disclose information and it will refocus the mindset to the short term for some companies. It's good. Some companies need to focus on the short term but it's not us. You know, I would go as far as saying and I might be totally wrong while saying this, but I think there's a bit of a glamour factor also. Yeah, it's a way of being recognized but it's very short term. Like the moment you get public, everyone praise you, you get a lot of praise and then it goes back to reality after deal with the devil. Yeah, you get the same articles that we publish the de because it not big deal. But, um, I'm extreme in everything I do for me. If I lose 1% of productivity, it's bad. I wouldn't want that for do. Um, but, but it's not the devil. It's a, what's the best career advice you ever got in your life from someone? Just do it. That's true because a lot of people a re thinking waiting for the good idea. Um, deciding how we should do it sometime it's just about move on, get the job done first, get the job and maybe it works. Maybe it won't work. But at least you move forward and what's the worst advice you have about advice? I don't know. Um, open uh uh, no, I didn't get bad advice. I didn't follow advice. I don't have mentors and everything. I was working in the other office, which is a farm, in a farm, quite alone, not meeting a lot of people. So I didn't get a lot of feedback. I'm gonna give you a compliment again. Same compliment. You're a crazy guy. Like I have not met anyone like you on the show. No, I think a lot of people who bootstrap do that. You start from where you are and your small things and I don't just mean your professional and even the guy you are, it's very different man. Like, you know, I, I have not seen this on the show and I've spoken to like 600 people, like I've not met someone who's done so much materially, but it's still so humble. Like I still feel you're like a code on the inside. You know, you, that's what I love. I am. A but then that affects a lot of how you look at life. Like someone, not someone else. Many other people in your position would have accomplished what you've accomplished at this point. Either would have chosen to sell it off and just relax or, you know, live more. But then will they be happy by doing that? I think different people have different life stories for me. There is nothing better that I can do than to do. The best I can do is to continue improving the software for companies. It's, I feel like I don't see what I can do better than that, I mean, are you changing as a person as you age? Not as a professional as a human being. Are you changing? I become better. No, I think, no, I become slower because of the age. Um But I think the vision and uh what I wanted to do has always been the same uh not at the very beginning but after a few years it, it has been there. How do you look at Silicon Valley and San Francisco generally? Is it, is it always going to be the center of tech in the world or? Yes, they have a big advance. Um For not for the reason we think the main reason is the cash. They have so many V CS or old ex Google employs with plenty of millions to invest that basically any ID can, can live there and when, when all the ID can leave, some of them will be good and will make a good company. Do you visit? I have an office in San Francisco. Yes. And before office was in uh uh in Silicon Valley and I lived three years there. You lived three years with the family? Yes. Can you talk to me more right now? You're OK to talk to me. Are you getting bored? No, you're enjoying this. I just want to stretch the conversation more. I want to get to know more. Let's go. You don't mind me asking all these questions, right? Like all this time How are you feeling, by the way, in this? Iiiii, I enjoy the, the, the, it's good. We have a good conversation and it's fun because you're getting to think. Uh, yes. And for me it's a different thing that what I used to do. So it's good. Ok. Um, usually people like yourself who come on the show, it's a thought exercise for them because the questions go, like, pretty intense. So, especially entrepreneurs enjoyed being on the show because they get to think much more. They get to reflect. I don't know if you're in that zone. I don't need to think that much because I know my subject. So these things I'm used to talk about. So what value is this conversation adding to you? Not, not, not just you, I'm surprised that you find that the discussion is so good for you that you get a lot of value from it for me just no matter. Ok, but you are adding a lot of value. Like that's why I'm surprised. And it's good to hear. I'm sure this one is going to get international viewers as well because you've not just spoken to the Indian audiences. You know, you've spoken to like, like a lot of people want to expand the businesses in India and they don't know how to my solution to all of them. And I've been asked this question abroad is I think you need to tie up with an Indian partner. Like Indians have the team mentality also like as we value to find. Uh So, I mean, that was my advice until today's podcast. Now, I'll just send them this podcast. Look at this guy's story. Um Maybe before we talk about America, one small question about India for the other foreigner founders, you know, founders from other countries who want to expand in this country. What's your advice to them? I think you just do it. Uh just uh book a flight ticket and come there a few weeks, discuss with people, meet people and in general are very entrepreneurial mindset. So you will find good relationship that you can start using and developing. Just a matter of what I did is that just go to India once you, once you are there, things naturally develop and this whole angle about the population being really big, it's a very legitimate reason to be here, right? Like because the market size is that big and it's growing, it's 8% growth of the GDP per year. It's bigger as in a population that's becoming richer, a big population that's becoming richer. That's the business logic about being here, right? Because at the end of the day, business has to be a little ruthless and mat mathematical. For me, the the initial reason I went to India is but um I was growing very fast in Belgium. Um I was a small company like 20 employees when I went to India and when you grow fast, I was signing project that was um the revenue of the project was bigger than my turnover. The presenting year. So bigger project more than my turnover. But once you do that, you quickly need to recruit and set up the team to deliver the client. And the problem I faced in Belgium. Um If I needed, I had 20 reports. If I needed 20 more, it was like 6 to 9 months to get them, but I just signed a client so I needed it right away. So it's not, it's not so much about the cost of the developers. It was that I needed to uh grow faster. And um and so I had this before because at the end, I wanted to recruit in Belgium. So I recruited Indians so that I have more time to catch up with my, they were sitting in India. Yes. How did you come to know that India has this developer access? Oh Everyone knows that everyone in the tech world knows that. If it was a center of the world, everyone knows that. Like you've heard of invoices and T CS, of course. But have you heard of them before you came to India? And how do you look at invoices and TC si never work with them. So I don't know. But what have you heard it? I mean T CS is 400,000 people. Can you imagine? 400 thousands? It's, it's huge. I saw you reading a book about the Tata group. Yeah, I just thought it page 20 or something. Why are you reading that? I read a lot of books but specifically the Tata Group book you're reading because you're in India. Uh, yes. But I think I would have read it before. No, I just, because it's one of the book I'm reading now. Ok. Coming back to America. Uh, three years in Silicon Valley. You live there? Yes. Uh Tell me everything, man. Like, what was your life like? What were the conversations like? Did you actually get a view of the future? Did you have conversations about A I back then? Which year is this one was seven or eight\", metadata={'source': 'transcription.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"we can do the pivot in the business model and say, OK, no, let's refocus on making a clean product. And that's when the, the adventure of Voodoo started. The mindset has always been the same is to develop business apps to help companies be more efficient, more productive. From a first time entrepreneur's perspective, what I'd like to say is that a first time entrepreneur has a lot of random business challenges that you don't anticipate in like accounting like uh HR management and the list goes on. So I your software handles all those miscellaneous business problems as well. So, so uh the, the what is it do today? Uh It's a suite of business apps. We have applications for pretty much everything SME S needs. Like you need an accounting software. We have one AC RM. We have one, we want to create a website. We have a website builder. You need a inventory management software with barcodes can be picked and you receive deliver. We have one app and if you put all these apps together, you have fully integrated company. And um and that's what we do. We offer tools to small and mid size companies so that they, they can perform better. What I find crazy about this is that you have a lot of data with you also. So you will be able to understand how different countries go about business in different ways. Yes. Yes, we have uh 12 millions of users. So it's probably the most installed management software out there. Er, p at least. Um so, and we are active in, we do accounting for 150 countries. So we are one of the largest uh spread uh in terms of different countries. You're a brave guy. Uh I'm just a good worker. I think you're just a hard working guy. I'm a hard working for the first seven years. I didn't get a single day or holiday for seven years and I was working like 14 days, 14 hours a day. It's not anymore the case. No, Saturday and Sunday. I, I work less but uh getting older, you think that plays a role? I think I don't have the same level of energy. I feel that already. Between 22 and 30. How old are you? I'm 30 your time. But I feel a difference in the energy I felt when I was 22. I work for 40. I'm 44. Really? How do you look so young dude? Um I don't know. It's good to know. Good genetics. Yes. You're a happy guy on the inside. I'm super happy. I love my job. I love my company. I love my project. I'm really happy in life. What are you the happiest about from a business perspective about your whole business career? Um So what I do like is that what we do as is super important uh because it helps companies, uh it helps people, we don't do management software for managers or for managing companies. I'm not interested in that. It's not interesting. I do tools so that every employee in the companies can do their job better, can save time, do less administrative tasks, less boring task. So we really help millions of people having a better life because if you think about it, you probably spend 30 40% of your time at work. So better do it with good tools so that you enjoy doing rather than doing boring administrative rerecording of data. And I feel like we have a massive impact on uh on the society because of that. We do it with a, we didn't talk about it but with a special business model, which is open source. So a lot of people can get it for free download, modify. And so we are reaching countries that could not afford that kind of software because it's free. Uh So the impact is really big of what we do. Can you explain what open source means? One and two? Why did you make it open source? Because it's a very different mentality. Like if you have built out a product, if you've built out a software, uh there has to be an intention in turning it into an open source software, open sources, you have kept the software available for the public. Yes. So open source is a license that says instead of constraining the software and say when you buy my software, you have minimum 10 user, maximum 10 user, you have this, this, this, this instead of putting constraints, we put rules so that we guarantee the user that they will be able to use the software for free. Um get the source code of the software so they can learn it, modify it for free and all the things will be free forever. So it's like a protection for the user. And the reason I did open source is because I'm passionate about open source since I was a student, I only use myself open source software. So when I developed software, I did it open source because you get a template from which you can build upon. No, because II I did, I didn't want to do another model. It was something I was, I'm passionate about that. I'd like to, I think software is knowledge and knowledge should be shared and I think short software, it's like knowledge should be shared to the world. Um And I think it's better, it was very hard because when you do a software for free getting money out of that is really difficult. So it took me uh maybe 15 years to understand the business model. What is the business model um Nowadays. So I tried everything I started as a service company as I explained to you. Then I moved to maintenance, selling service, like support upgrade. Um didn't work that well, it worked. But uh after 500 employees, I couldn't, I was, I had, I've had like seven years close to bank bankruptcy. So at some point it's ok. I have to change. My passion about open source is good, but at some point, it's good to remain alive too. Um And so now the business model that works is what we called open core and an open core business. But anyways where you have 80% of the applications, a re free and open source and we add 20% of application where you have to pay for premium. It's like a premium, but it's like two different products. Some people can just use the open source one and others uh can use the what we call a do enterprise, which is the full version. That's the one that is working for you right now. Yes, for EXA MP. If you need AC RM, it's open source is free. You need a website, free an open source. You need inventory sales, purchase, it's free and open source. You need accounting. You will have to pay the accounting version because it's only in the paid version. So people gain trust in your software from the free part. And then they say, yeah, this is a good software design is great. Functionality is great. Let me pay for like this additional. Uh Yes, some do that. 10% 90% doesn't pay, never pay. But the best is the word of mouth. You know, when you build a company, the most difficult part is marketing, word of mouth, building a big audience of users. And, and the good thing when you are free is that you quickly get billions of users. And uh even though they will never pay some of them, what they will do is bring you uh more customer because they will tell to their friend this uh software is great. I'm using every day. You should check it and maybe one of them will pay. So based on those 10% parts of your software that are actually premium which people pay for. You're supporting the whole business, including the 90% which is for me, it was a very philosophical problem because I was passionate about about source and I did not want to sell proper source of software. I was against that. Uh But it was a very bad decision. It was a very bright mindset because at the time I had something like maybe 100 developers maximum, I couldn't pay more. Um And now that I have 10% non open source or 20% non open source, 80% open source, I can afford paying hundreds of developers. Uh So I contribute way more to the open source world than what I did before, even though I'm not 100% open source today. So it's something I didn't understand, took me years because I refused that. But once I did that, I switched the business model and then the company started to skyrocket. You know, there's a lot of lessons that Indian entrepreneurs, young Indian entrepreneurs can actually learn from this in terms of your selling to the world. Here, we, a lot of us have dreams about selling to the world as well, but I don't think they are educated in that aspect in terms of if you built out something in India, how do you ensure that someone sitting in Britain or Nigeria or Brazil would actually use your stuff? So you, you've had an expansion outside your own country, right? Yes. You know, we are Belgians, Belgium is nothing. It's tell me and the people. So by nature, if you want to do business, we a re forced to export because our market is nothing. Um You don't have the SA me issue in India, but you have also a lot strong incentive to export uh in software. It's easy, it's just build the best software. The reason all the works is we have the best uh you have, we have the best CRM. We have a modern website builder. We much better than wordpress or, or, or, or Shopify uh and we build the best, took us 20 years. But once you get the best software is like compound interest you build and you build and you build everywhere, it gets better and better and better. And the revenue you get from the software increase exponentially based on what you build. It's like uh creating a massive asset that is joining more and more revenue over the years. But it takes time, it takes a lot of time because in order to be the best, uh you have, you have to develop and develop and develop, especially in open source, in open source, it's very hard because, you know, in property software, when you sell the software on a license, you can have a lot of competitors and then they will all differentiate themselves. Open source is like a transparent market. Um It's like because it's free, everyone will test before buying so they test, they play with it and so everyone will choose the best product. So in the open source, it's a winner. Take all market, there is one winner but no second player and that is very hard. So it requires for you to invest a lot in research and development um in order to build the best product. And before you, you are not the best, you, you get\", metadata={'source': 'transcription.txt'}),\n",

No one\\'s ever said that on this show, they should tell me from the perspective you had before you actually went to China. Why did you choose that country? And what was the reality check before we went to China? I saw China like India. But then the problem is in China is that first you cannot appoint a company in China, a company in China has to be owned by a Chinese person. If you have to choose one country to invest, it is India. And if I have to choose the second one, I would pick India too. Really? Yes, there is no other country with that level of opportunities for the other foreigner founders, you know, founders from other countries who want to expand in this country.

So you will find good relationship that you can start using and you are a very memorable guy. Like if you\\'ve done so much in life and you\\'re so humble, you know, I find that very crazy man because I don\\'t like saying this, but you don\\'t see too much of that in India. As I\\'m recording this intro, Mister Fabian Punker has just left our studio after a three hour conversation. I rarely stretch conversations up to the three hour mark unless I truly feel like I\\'m extracting value out of my guest, created a business conversation on the podcast after a very long time because this business story is very, very interesting as you saw in the trailer. It\\'s about a self made billionaire who now finds himself in Gujarat in India because he\\'s trying to expand his business operations while he sits in Gandhinagar. So of course, we spoke about expanding business within India, but he\\'s had the experience of living in America of trying to expand his business in China. So it\\'s a very global business oriented conversation. If you\\'re an Indian viewer, you\\'re going to learn about your country once again. But from a foreigner\\'s perspective, from a very, very successful founder\\'s perspective. And if you\\'re someone who\\'s looking at India as a possible place, you\\'d like to expand your own business ventures. This is the ultimate one on one that I could bring forward for you. All the questions were centered around extracting value for business owners and people who want to learn more about international markets. It\\'s a very deep podcast. It\\'s also a lot of fun because Fabian\\'s personality is very easy going. He is one of Europe\\'s youngest billionaires ever, but he speaks from a very humble, very practical place, enjoyed speaking with him and I\\'m sure going to enjoy on this special episode of the RV show, Fabian. Hello. How are you? I\\'m good. Uh I need to be very honest with you before we start talking, I love talking to foreigners on my podcast. It\\'s a lot of fun and for us it\\'s good too. For me it\\'s the first time in India. So, but you\\'ve been here for nine months. Yeah, I\\'m living in India, but I\\'ve never done a show. I was focusing on my business. I will begin this podcast with a very simple question game show. Um Mama Gujarati Bolo Cho. I find it so fascinating that, you know, Gujarati, dude, just a little bit. How long have you been in Gujarat? Nine months? And you\\'ve been in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Gandhinagar. How are you liking life in India? Uh It\\'s amazing. Yeah, I really love it. It\\'s a, it\\'s an experience, not everything is easy, things are difficult, but they are really good things. So I really like it, dude. What I find crazy about you is you have had a 20 year entrepreneurial career, then you\\'ve traveled all over the world. And now you\\'re targeting India as a place for expansion and you\\'re the founder of your start up. But the founder himself is now sitting in India to try to expand into this market. Yeah, even the people, so I come from Belgium. Even the people of Belgium don\\'t understand why it came to India. I had to explain them calling me the Slumdog billionaire because they imagine India like, yeah, because they don\\'t know, Of course. Um, but I\\'m really glad I did it because, uh, the business has been amazing experience has been very good as for the family. So it really good. Ok. What else? Tell me about your life. How\\'s your day in your life in India? Uh, it\\'s great, depending. There are some good and bad stuff. The worst is the weather. I mean, the summer is just crazy in India. It\\'s way too hot for me. Uh, you know, in Belgium today it\\'s like minus 10 °C. So when you get the summer at 4550 plus in India, it\\'s, it\\'s very hot, very difficult. Um, but, um, what I like about India is, uh, you know, you live with nature, nature with, uh, animals, uh, in, in Europe, you don\\'t have animals in the street anymore, even, even, um, of course, you don\\'t have cows and, and dogs, but even birds there are so less birds compared to here. So it\\'s nice feeling to, to live with nature and, and, and animals. That\\'s all, you know, the first thing you notice in the street when you walk in the street, second thing is there are way too many people, but I think you get the opposite. If you go to Europe, you probably feel alone and in danger because there is not that much people around you depends on where you are in Europe, but you do feel in a very positive way isolated which actually calms down your head. Like it\\'s, it\\'s one of my favorite places to travel to because I know when I come back, I\\'m going to be very relaxed. So it\\'s a very relaxing place. That\\'s what I say about Europe. Uh I find it crazy that you\\'re actually thinking about staying in India for a long time. What\\'s in your mind? What\\'s in your heart about like staying here? So I came for the business. Um We went to a point where for do um what we get in India was not mature enough. We had a lot of activities, a lot of partners, we had something like 40,000 developers on our software on do in India, but they were not selling on the India market, they were selling in the US and in Europe. So it\\'s, it was for me like a big opportunity that we didn\\'t tap in. You mean all your, not only because we only have 4000 employees, but we work with partners, our companies offering services on our product. And we had a lot of partners in India, but they were not addressing the Indian market. They were just looking out services in the US and in Europe and I wanted to refocus on the domestic market because India\\'s uh SME S is big. Uh GDP is growing at 8% per year. So it\\'s a massive market 1/5 of the world population. So you cannot close your eye to such a big and future economy. So I came here in order to develop the local market, you know, in order to understand you better, why don\\'t you introduce your own life\\'s work a little bit before I ask you more questions about India and Europe. OK. Probably the right way to start because people especially business oriented audiences, which is a big chunk of youtube audiences now are very interested to know about how the world looks at India and about how you want to sell in India. And why do you want to sell here? Because honestly, Indians, if you look at it from a mass scale, are not easy customers, they\\'re difficult customers to win over. So I want to get into all those tangents about all your challenges you faced here, et cetera, et cetera. But let\\'s begin with a little bit about your story. Yes, you began as a coder. Yeah, I was a developer uh engineer I started to and IIII I love business. So I was reading the 223 books, uh, about management psychology to develop my business every week. Um, I did a lot of things and this one which is to do work better than the others. And so I started alone after two years, I had one employee after three years, 34 or five, this is in 2004. That was in 2002. Yes, when I was still a student and then I grew, uh organically bootstrapped the company. Uh I started to sell services on this software. So the software is, is a management software. At the beginning, I was selling services. So I asked Ken, what do you want? And I was developing everything and I did that until 2 2010. And at that time, I had a software that had a lot of features because I developed everything the customer would asked for. So it was full of feature but ugly complex uh and everything. Uh And at that time, I had uh 100 employees. Um So I decided to do a pivot in the business me and say we cannot do service and develop everything people need. We need to focus as a software vendor and develop a clean product uh and not for customer but develop what\\'s good for the mass. So for eight years, you got requests from businesses, they asked you to develop Softwares which would help the individual business problems. And eventually you develop so many Softwares that you realize, hey, hold on, I can actually turn this into a tech product and probably make it more profitable than what we\\'re doing. It was a bit because, uh, I, from one day to another, I decided to stop services, stop all revenues. I had 100 employees and say, ok, now we\\'ll focus on something else. We\\'ll create a network of partners. They will do the service and we will sell maintenance. So from one day to one, you will sell what maintenance services upgrades. And that was risky because we would stop all our activities from one day to another to refocus on something else. So I raised two millions of Euro uh with French V CS at the time. Uh so that we can do the pivot in the business model and say, OK, no, let\\'s refocus on making a clean product. And that\\'s when the, the adventure of Voodoo started.

      "Based on the conversation, some of the main challenges and advantages of doing business in India mentioned are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Challenges:\n",
      "1. The Indian market is very price sensitive. Indians tend to focus a lot on getting the cheapest option rather than looking at quality or efficiency gains from using better tools/services.\n",
      "2. There is a tendency for Indian companies to try to do everything themselves initially instead of buying services, even when professional services could help implement things more effectively.\n",
      "3. Getting people to actually show up for events/meetings can be difficult, with high no-show rates common.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advantages: \n",
      "1. India has a huge domestic market with over 1 billion population and rapidly growing GDP, providing massive opportunities.\n",
      "2. Indians are open to international businesses and there is an entrepreneurial mindset.\n",
      "3. Decision making can be faster in India compared to Europe/US for transformational changes within companies.\n",
      "4. The market is growing fast and there is a need to replace old software/tools with modern solutions.\n",
      "5. The negotiation skills of Indians, especially Gujaratis, are very strong which can be leveraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Insights:\n",
      "- Indians sometimes prefer using cheaper human labor rather than automating processes if the automation costs more, unlike in the West.\n",
      "- Building a quality product/service and good marketing are important to succeed rather than just focusing on low prices in India.\n",
      "- Having the right local leadership is crucial when expanding to a new country like India.\n"
