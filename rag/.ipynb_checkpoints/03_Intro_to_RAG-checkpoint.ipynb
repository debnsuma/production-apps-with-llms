You can have a good location, average director, it\\'s gonna be painful.\"\\n\\nHe explains that when expanding to a new location, they first identify the best person/employee within their company who can take the lead, and then open the office wherever that person is based or prefers to be. The location itself is secondary to having the right leadership in place.\\n\\nHe gives examples of opening offices in places like Buffalo, New York and Gandhinagar, Gujarat not because those were specifically targeted locations, but because they had the right people to lead those offices there.

       "[Document(page_content=\"that. You like how you're working, right? The reason is that um uh public companies tend to refocus on the short term, you know, you have to uh publish earning codes with the, the sales number and if the numbers are good, everyone is happy, they buy the shares. If numbers are bad, people are not happy and your employees are frustrated because they have shares and it's bad. So public companies have a tendency to focus on the short term to saves, saves of the moments of the quarter and so on. I don't want that the success of FU is always to build for the long term. And I don't want to see on to look for the short term or the sales number of the quarter. One, the other thing is I'm so much focused on productivity and efficiency. Uh When you get public, you need extra layers of reporting transparency, uh anything like that. Uh So second reason I don't want that I want to be super efficient, decide right away instead of asking the board of directors. Um And third, I like open and transparent communication. You know, I just said the company was 4.5 billion of euro. If I was a public company, I could go to jail because I disclosed information uh not be before the earning calls. I think if, if I would have sent that to maybe not publicly but to some I could go to jail. I don't want that. I want to be able to say whatever I want to inform my employees uh and be transparent. Why do you think founders choose to go public? I think a lot of them don't understand, it's just a way to get cash. Um But to understand the consequence of that, most of them don't catch it really another thing. It's bad. I think as a source of cash public is quite good, it's efficient but it comes with some drawbacks like you have to uh have extra layers of reporting complexity. You cannot disclose information and it will refocus the mindset to the short term for some companies. It's good. Some companies need to focus on the short term but it's not us. You know, I would go as far as saying and I might be totally wrong while saying this, but I think there's a bit of a glamour factor also. Yeah, it's a way of being recognized but it's very short term. Like the moment you get public, everyone praise you, you get a lot of praise and then it goes back to reality after deal with the devil. Yeah, you get the same articles that we publish the de because it not big deal. But, um, I'm extreme in everything I do for me. If I lose 1% of productivity, it's bad. I wouldn't want that for do. Um, but, but it's not the devil. It's a, what's the best career advice you ever got in your life from someone? Just do it. That's true because a lot of people a re thinking waiting for the good idea. Um, deciding how we should do it sometime it's just about move on, get the job done first, get the job and maybe it works. Maybe it won't work. But at least you move forward and what's the worst advice you have about advice? I don't know. Um, open uh uh, no, I didn't get bad advice. I didn't follow advice. I don't have mentors and everything. I was working in the other office, which is a farm, in a farm, quite alone, not meeting a lot of people. So I didn't get a lot of feedback. I'm gonna give you a compliment again. Same compliment. You're a crazy guy. Like I have not met anyone like you on the show. No, I think a lot of people who bootstrap do that. You start from where you are and your small things and I don't just mean your professional and even the guy you are, it's very different man. Like, you know, I, I have not seen this on the show and I've spoken to like 600 people, like I've not met someone who's done so much materially, but it's still so humble. Like I still feel you're like a code on the inside. You know, you, that's what I love. I am. A but then that affects a lot of how you look at life. Like someone, not someone else. Many other people in your position would have accomplished what you've accomplished at this point. Either would have chosen to sell it off and just relax or, you know, live more. But then will they be happy by doing that? I think different people have different life stories for me. There is nothing better that I can do than to do. The best I can do is to continue improving the software for companies. It's, I feel like I don't see what I can do better than that, I mean, are you changing as a person as you age? Not as a professional as a human being. Are you changing? I become better. No, I think, no, I become slower because of the age. Um But I think the vision and uh what I wanted to do has always been the same uh not at the very beginning but after a few years it, it has been there. How do you look at Silicon Valley and San Francisco generally? Is it, is it always going to be the center of tech in the world or? Yes, they have a big advance. Um For not for the reason we think the main reason is the cash. They have so many V CS or old ex Google employs with plenty of millions to invest that basically any ID can, can live there and when, when all the ID can leave, some of them will be good and will make a good company. Do you visit? I have an office in San Francisco. Yes. And before office was in uh uh in Silicon Valley and I lived three years there. You lived three years with the family? Yes. Can you talk to me more right now? You're OK to talk to me. Are you getting bored? No, you're enjoying this. I just want to stretch the conversation more. I want to get to know more. Let's go. You don't mind me asking all these questions, right? Like all this time How are you feeling, by the way, in this? Iiiii, I enjoy the, the, the, it's good. We have a good conversation and it's fun because you're getting to think. Uh, yes. And for me it's a different thing that what I used to do. So it's good. Ok. Um, usually people like yourself who come on the show, it's a thought exercise for them because the questions go, like, pretty intense. So, especially entrepreneurs enjoyed being on the show because they get to think much more. They get to reflect. I don't know if you're in that zone. I don't need to think that much because I know my subject. So these things I'm used to talk about. So what value is this conversation adding to you? Not, not, not just you, I'm surprised that you find that the discussion is so good for you that you get a lot of value from it for me just no matter. Ok, but you are adding a lot of value. Like that's why I'm surprised. And it's good to hear. I'm sure this one is going to get international viewers as well because you've not just spoken to the Indian audiences. You know, you've spoken to like, like a lot of people want to expand the businesses in India and they don't know how to my solution to all of them. And I've been asked this question abroad is I think you need to tie up with an Indian partner. Like Indians have the team mentality also like as we value to find. Uh So, I mean, that was my advice until today's podcast. Now, I'll just send them this podcast. Look at this guy's story. Um Maybe before we talk about America, one small question about India for the other foreigner founders, you know, founders from other countries who want to expand in this country. What's your advice to them? I think you just do it. Uh just uh book a flight ticket and come there a few weeks, discuss with people, meet people and in general are very entrepreneurial mindset. So you will find good relationship that you can start using and developing. Just a matter of what I did is that just go to India once you, once you are there, things naturally develop and this whole angle about the population being really big, it's a very legitimate reason to be here, right? Like because the market size is that big and it's growing, it's 8% growth of the GDP per year. It's bigger as in a population that's becoming richer, a big population that's becoming richer. That's the business logic about being here, right? Because at the end of the day, business has to be a little ruthless and mat mathematical. For me, the the initial reason I went to India is but um I was growing very fast in Belgium. Um I was a small company like 20 employees when I went to India and when you grow fast, I was signing project that was um the revenue of the project was bigger than my turnover. The presenting year. So bigger project more than my turnover. But once you do that, you quickly need to recruit and set up the team to deliver the client. And the problem I faced in Belgium. Um If I needed, I had 20 reports. If I needed 20 more, it was like 6 to 9 months to get them, but I just signed a client so I needed it right away. So it's not, it's not so much about the cost of the developers. It was that I needed to uh grow faster. And um and so I had this before because at the end, I wanted to recruit in Belgium. So I recruited Indians so that I have more time to catch up with my, they were sitting in India. Yes. How did you come to know that India has this developer access? Oh Everyone knows that everyone in the tech world knows that. If it was a center of the world, everyone knows that. Like you've heard of invoices and T CS, of course. But have you heard of them before you came to India? And how do you look at invoices and TC si never work with them. So I don't know. But what have you heard it? I mean T CS is 400,000 people. Can you imagine? 400 thousands? It's, it's huge. I saw you reading a book about the Tata group. Yeah, I just thought it page 20 or something. Why are you reading that? I read a lot of books but specifically the Tata Group book you're reading because you're in India. Uh, yes. But I think I would have read it before. No, I just, because it's one of the book I'm reading now. Ok. Coming back to America. Uh, three years in Silicon Valley. You live there? Yes. Uh Tell me everything, man. Like, what was your life like? What were the conversations like? Did you actually get a view of the future? Did you have conversations about A I back then? Which year is this one was seven or eight\", metadata={'source': 'transcription.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"that. You like how you're working, right? The reason is that um uh public companies tend to refocus on the short term, you know, you have to uh publish earning codes with the, the sales number and if the numbers are good, everyone is happy, they buy the shares. If numbers are bad, people are not happy and your employees are frustrated because they have shares and it's bad. So public companies have a tendency to focus on the short term to saves, saves of the moments of the quarter and so on. I don't want that the success of FU is always to build for the long term. And I don't want to see on to look for the short term or the sales number of the quarter. One, the other thing is I'm so much focused on productivity and efficiency. Uh When you get public, you need extra layers of reporting transparency, uh anything like that. Uh So second reason I don't want that I want to be super efficient, decide right away instead of asking the board of directors. Um And third, I like open and transparent communication. You know, I just said the company was 4.5 billion of euro. If I was a public company, I could go to jail because I disclosed information uh not be before the earning calls. I think if, if I would have sent that to maybe not publicly but to some I could go to jail. I don't want that. I want to be able to say whatever I want to inform my employees uh and be transparent. Why do you think founders choose to go public? I think a lot of them don't understand, it's just a way to get cash.

      "\n",
      "Challenges:\n",
      "1. The Indian market is very price sensitive. Indian customers tend to focus a lot on cost and go for the cheapest option, sometimes at the expense of quality or efficiency.\n",
      "2. Many Indian companies try to do everything themselves instead of buying services, even when external help could be beneficial. This is driven by the desire to save costs.\n",
      "3. There is too much focus on saving money rather than investing in things that could improve sales and operations like good websites, UI/UX, efficient processes etc.\n",
      "4. Marketing to Indian businesses is a challenge since the company was previously known more among developers than businessmen.\n",

      "1. India is a fast deciding market compared to other regions like Europe where decision cycles can be very long.\n",
      "2. Indian companies want to move with speed.\n",
      "3. The large population provides access to affordable labor, allowing tasks to be done cheaply by employing more people instead of automating.\n",
      "4. The local Indian market is big and growing fast, providing opportunities to sell software and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other Insights:\n",
      "1. Indian customers ask for the price first without even seeing the product/service.\n",
      "2. The price sensitivity stems from the lower levels of income/quality of life compared to the US.\n",
      "3. Indian startups focus more on being profitable rather than just raising money, which drives cost-consciousness.\n",
      "4. However, this cost focus can make Indian companies miss opportunities to improve sales by using better tools/services.\n"
